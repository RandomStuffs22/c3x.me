Hi

My name is Courtenay.

I wear a lot of hats. I'm mainly a sociopathic weirdo, but I am also known as a developer, [founder/ceo](http://entp.com) [^ceo], artist, and [musician](http://soundcloud.com/f3mr/sets). I spend most of my time in Las Vegas where I have a recording studio, but you can also find me regularly in Portland, Oregon, Los Angeles, and San Francisco (in ascending order of likelihood).

I look vaguely like one of these images, depending on mood and access to scissors:

</div>

I've spent years honing my technical skillset so that I'm firmly stuck in the hottest stack of five years ago. So my expertise revolves around Ruby, Rails 2.3, javascript (mainly jQuery), and mysql; newer passions include chef, elasticsearch and redis. I have a bunch of [abandoned open source projects](http://github.com/courtenay) on Github.

I own a small record label called Motivator and a [vegan/gluten-free food cart](http://theheartcart.com) in Portland; and a Burning man art project that involves hard hats called the Erection Crew.

I'm somewhat obsessed with all the normal nerdy things like near-space balloons, linguistics, automation, coffee, surveillance societies, western subcultures, post-capitalist alternatives, DIY human augmentation, analog synthesis, and combinations therein.

[^ceo]: I believe in a flat egalitarian hierarchy and we only have about 6 employees, so really I'm just a corraller-of-cats. Me being a "ceo/founder" means you can't hire me unless you buy my whole company (this question comes up a lot).
